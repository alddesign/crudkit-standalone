# CRUDKit standalone
## About
CRUDKit standalone is a ready to use version of [alddesign/crudkit](https://github.com/alddesign/crudkit). So you dont need to deal with setting up a laravel project and composer.

It is configured to run the included sample database by default.

## Getting started
* An Apache 2 webserver with PHP version >= 8.0.2 is needed.
* Download and extract [crudkit.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alddesign/crudkit-standalone/master/crudkit.zip) 
* Put the extracted "crudkit" folder to your webservers `htdocs` directory. 
* This is your laravel root directory from now on.
* The next steps are the same as for the original project. So please see "Setup on Webserver" section of the original project: [readme-installation#setup-on-webserver](https://github.com/alddesign/crudkit/blob/master/readme-installation.md#setup-on-webserver).
